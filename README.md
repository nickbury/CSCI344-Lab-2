Displays a stream of tweets with the tag "phone gap"

Assignment: <br />
Using HTML, CSS, jQuery and cTwitter, build an application that does the following:

1) It tracks some technology-related term(s) that are being commonly used.


2) It displays at most 10 tweets at a time (after the 10 most recent tweets are displayed, the earliest tweets start to disappear to make room for the new tweets)

3) It must use jQuery's fadeOut/fadeIn or slideDown/slideUp methods in some way.
